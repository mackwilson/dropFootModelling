BME 355 course project. Modelling the shank-foot complex through the gait cycles, for normal gait and with foot drop syndrome.

The model consists of rigid body physics for the food, shank, and upper leg segments. The upper leg is simplified and only torques from the knee and hip are considered in the forces. The model is simulated over time for various scenarios.
